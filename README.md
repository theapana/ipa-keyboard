# IPA Keyboard Layout

Design principles:

- first and foremost, key commands for an IPA symbol should have _phonetic
    grounding_
- secondly, if typographical cues clearly outweigh complex key commands required
    to implement phonetically grounded sequence, then those should be used
    instead
    - e.g. /ʌ/ = unrounded, lowered /o/; vs /ʌ/ = turned v
    - e.g. /oe/ = rounded, lowered /e/; vs some typographical combination of o + e


Objectives:

- integrate with existing keyboard layouts (e.g. Dvorak, Qwerty)
- describe the IPA keyboard "spec" so that keyboard layout designers may
    integrate this into their own designs if they wish
- minimize cognitive load for linguists, language enthusiasts, hobbyists wishing
    to type IPA transcriptions

This project aims to (1) define a keyboard spec (2) illustrate why each key
sequence is chosen, using an interactive website.
